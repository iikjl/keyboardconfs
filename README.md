# My keyboard conf save
for my use and if anyone wants my keyboard configurations. Keeping mainly keymap.c files and cheatseets here. Rest of the files are in my private repos
Based on QMK firmware and setting up these files in the latest QMK build + qmk sys build will generate the hex file. 

Currently there are my Kyria, Launchpad and Charybdis keymaps here
